# Bypassing-object-level-authorization
Bypassing object-level authorization is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly enforce access control checks for specific resources or objects. This allows attackers to access, modify, or delete resources they are not authorized to interact with.

Here’s a breakdown of **object-level authorization bypass**, examples, and how to mitigate it:

---

### **How It Happens**
1. **Insufficient Authorization Checks**  
   The application fails to check whether the authenticated user has permission to access a specific object.
   
2. **Predictable or Exposed Object Identifiers**  
   Object identifiers (e.g., IDs in URLs or API parameters) are predictable, such as incremental numeric values (`/resource/123`) or easily guessable UUIDs.

3. **Lack of Role-Based Restrictions**  
   Users with lower privileges can access objects meant for administrators or other users due to missing role or privilege checks.

4. **Direct Object References (Insecure)**
   The application uses unvalidated direct references like `/api/data/456` without checking if the user has rights to access `456`.

---

### **Common Attack Scenarios**
1. **URL Manipulation**
   - A user with access to `/user/profile/1001` modifies the URL to `/user/profile/1002` to view another user's data.

2. **API Exploitation**
   - A user sends an API request for a resource they don’t own, like:
     ```
     GET /api/v1/orders/456
     ```
     If no ownership verification is performed, they can access someone else’s order details.

3. **Mass Assignment**
   - Attackers manipulate form inputs or API payloads to include properties they shouldn't have access to, like `isAdmin=true` or setting unauthorized object references.

---

### **Mitigation Techniques**
1. **Implement Proper Object-Level Authorization**
   - Verify that the current user is authorized to access the requested resource.
   - Implement checks based on roles, permissions, or ownership.

2. **Use Indirect Object References**
   - Replace direct identifiers (e.g., `orderID=456`) with opaque, hard-to-guess references (e.g., tokens or hashed IDs).

3. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - Ensure users have access only to the resources they need for their role.

4. **Centralized Authorization Logic**
   - Use a centralized system for handling object-level authorization rather than implementing ad hoc checks in different parts of the code.

5. **Secure API Design**
   - Validate all input parameters, especially those identifying objects.
   - Log access attempts and monitor for anomalies.

6. **Conduct Regular Testing**
   - Use automated tools and manual penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
   - OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can help uncover object-level authorization flaws.

### **Example Secure Code**
```python
# Example: Flask API with Ownership Check
@app.route('/user/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    # Ensure the logged-in user owns the resource
    if user_id != current_user.id:
        abort(403)  # Forbidden
    user = User.query.get_or_404(user_id)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```
