# Bypassing-object-level-authorization
Bypassing object-level authorization is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly enforce access control checks for specific resources or objects. This allows attackers to access, modify, or delete resources they are not authorized to interact with.

Here’s a breakdown of **object-level authorization bypass**, examples, and how to mitigate it:

---

### **How It Happens**
1. **Insufficient Authorization Checks**  
   The application fails to check whether the authenticated user has permission to access a specific object.
   
2. **Predictable or Exposed Object Identifiers**  
   Object identifiers (e.g., IDs in URLs or API parameters) are predictable, such as incremental numeric values (`/resource/123`) or easily guessable UUIDs.

3. **Lack of Role-Based Restrictions**  
   Users with lower privileges can access objects meant for administrators or other users due to missing role or privilege checks.

4. **Direct Object References (Insecure)**
   The application uses unvalidated direct references like `/api/data/456` without checking if the user has rights to access `456`.

---

### **Common Attack Scenarios**
1. **URL Manipulation**
   - A user with access to `/user/profile/1001` modifies the URL to `/user/profile/1002` to view another user's data.

2. **API Exploitation**
   - A user sends an API request for a resource they don’t own, like:
     ```
     GET /api/v1/orders/456
     ```
     If no ownership verification is performed, they can access someone else’s order details.

3. **Mass Assignment**
   - Attackers manipulate form inputs or API payloads to include properties they shouldn't have access to, like `isAdmin=true` or setting unauthorized object references.

---

### **Mitigation Techniques**
1. **Implement Proper Object-Level Authorization**
   - Verify that the current user is authorized to access the requested resource.
   - Implement checks based on roles, permissions, or ownership.

2. **Use Indirect Object References**
   - Replace direct identifiers (e.g., `orderID=456`) with opaque, hard-to-guess references (e.g., tokens or hashed IDs).

3. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - Ensure users have access only to the resources they need for their role.

4. **Centralized Authorization Logic**
   - Use a centralized system for handling object-level authorization rather than implementing ad hoc checks in different parts of the code.

5. **Secure API Design**
   - Validate all input parameters, especially those identifying objects.
   - Log access attempts and monitor for anomalies.

6. **Conduct Regular Testing**
   - Use automated tools and manual penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
   - OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite can help uncover object-level authorization flaws.

---

### **Example Secure Code**
```python
# Example: Flask API with Ownership Check
@app.route('/user/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    # Ensure the logged-in user owns the resource
    if user_id != current_user.id:
        abort(403)  # Forbidden
    user = User.query.get_or_404(user_id)
    return jsonify(user.to_dict())
```
Here are **specific examples** of object-level authorization vulnerabilities and corresponding solutions for various scenarios. These examples are tailored to highlight how attackers exploit weak access controls and how you can prevent such vulnerabilities.

---

### **Example 1: URL Manipulation**
**Scenario:**  
An e-commerce application has a user dashboard where users can view their orders via:  
`GET /orders/{order_id}`

**Exploit:**  
An authenticated user with access to `GET /orders/123` modifies the URL to `GET /orders/124` to view another user's order details. If there is no authorization check, the attacker gains unauthorized access.

**Solution:**  
Verify ownership of the resource:  
```python
@app.route('/orders/<int:order_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_order(order_id):
    # Fetch the order
    order = Order.query.get_or_404(order_id)
    
    # Ensure the logged-in user is the owner of the order
    if order.user_id != current_user.id:
        abort(403)  # Forbidden

    return jsonify(order.to_dict())
```

---

### **Example 2: Insecure API**
**Scenario:**  
An API allows users to update their profile via:  
`POST /api/v1/user/update`  
with a payload:
```json
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

**Exploit:**  
An attacker sends a modified payload:
```json
{
  "user_id": 124,  # Another user's ID
  "email": "hacker@example.com"
}
```

If the API does not verify the `user_id` against the logged-in user, the attacker updates another user's profile.

**Solution:**  
Ignore `user_id` from the payload and use the authenticated user's ID:  
```python
@app.route('/api/v1/user/update', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def update_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    current_user.email = data.get('email')  # Update only the logged-in user's data
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Profile updated successfully!"})
```

---

### **Example 3: Predictable Object Identifiers**
**Scenario:**  
A banking application allows users to access their transaction history via:  
`GET /transactions/{transaction_id}`

**Exploit:**  
Transaction IDs are sequential (e.g., `101, 102, 103`). An attacker guesses IDs and accesses transactions belonging to other users.

**Solution 1: Validate Ownership**  
```python
@app.route('/transactions/<int:transaction_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_transaction(transaction_id):
    transaction = Transaction.query.get_or_404(transaction_id)
    
    # Verify the transaction belongs to the logged-in user
    if transaction.user_id != current_user.id:
        abort(403)  # Forbidden

    return jsonify(transaction.to_dict())
```

**Solution 2: Use Indirect Identifiers**  
Instead of exposing `transaction_id`, use opaque tokens or UUIDs:  
```python
transaction_id = generate_uuid()  # Create a random, hard-to-guess identifier
```

---

### **Example 4: Mass Assignment Vulnerability**
**Scenario:**  
A web application allows users to update their profile via:  
```html
<input type="text" name="username" value="current_user">
<input type="text" name="isAdmin" value="false">
```

**Exploit:**  
An attacker modifies the `isAdmin` field in the form to `true`, gaining admin privileges.

**Solution:**  
Whitelist fields and ignore sensitive ones:  
```python
@app.route('/user/update', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def update_profile():
    data = request.form
    current_user.username = data.get('username')  # Allow safe updates only
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Profile updated!"})
```

---

### **Example 5: Lack of Role-Based Access Control**
**Scenario:**  
An admin dashboard endpoint exists at `/admin/dashboard`. A user without admin privileges navigates to this endpoint and gains unauthorized access.

**Solution:**  
Enforce role-based access controls (RBAC):  
```python
@app.route('/admin/dashboard')
@login_required
@admin_required  # Custom decorator for admin-only access
def admin_dashboard():
    return render_template('admin_dashboard.html')
```

**Custom Decorator:**  
```python
def admin_required(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if not current_user.is_admin:
            abort(403)  # Forbidden
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

---

### **Example 6: File Access via ID**
**Scenario:**  
A file-sharing platform stores files with IDs, e.g., `GET /files/{file_id}`, without verifying ownership.

**Exploit:**  
An attacker sends `GET /files/456`, accessing files they don't own.

**Solution:**  
Check ownership before providing access:  
```python
@app.route('/files/<int:file_id>', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def get_file(file_id):
    file = File.query.get_or_404(file_id)
    
    # Ensure the user owns the file
    if file.user_id != current_user.id:
        abort(403)  # Forbidden

    return send_file(file.path)
```

### **Testing Object-Level Authorization**
- **Automated Tools:**  
  - **Burp Suite**: Use the "Repeater" tool to modify API requests and observe responses.
  - **OWASP ZAP**: Automate scanning for insecure direct object references (IDORs).

- **Manual Testing Steps:**  
  1. Test predictable object identifiers by incrementing/decrementing.
  2. Use low-privilege accounts to attempt access to high-privilege resources.
  3. Inject manipulated parameters in API requests.

Using **Burp Suite** for testing authorization vulnerabilities, including **object-level authorization bypass**, is a common practice. Here’s a step-by-step guide to identify and exploit such issues, along with examples and tips.

---

### **Step 1: Configure Burp Suite**
1. **Set Up Proxy**  
   - Configure Burp Suite as a proxy in your browser to intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
   - Add your application's domain to the **target scope** to limit scanning.

2. **Enable Interception**  
   - Ensure interception is enabled for the requests you want to analyze.

3. **Set Up User Accounts**  
   - Prepare two user accounts:
     - **Low-privileged user** (e.g., regular user)
     - **High-privileged user** (e.g., admin or owner of resources)

---

### **Step 2: Manual Testing for Object-Level Authorization**
1. **Identify Object IDs**  
   - Browse the application as the low-privileged user and look for object identifiers (IDs) in:
     - URLs (`/orders/123`, `/users/456`)
     - Query parameters (`?id=789`)
     - JSON payloads (`{"order_id": 101}`)

2. **Intercept Requests**  
   - Use the **Proxy** tab to capture and modify requests.  
   Example request:  
   ```http
   GET /api/orders/123 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Authorization: Bearer <low-privilege-user-token>
   ```

3. **Modify Object IDs**  
   - Change the `123` in the request to a value that you suspect might belong to another user (e.g., `124`).

4. **Send Modified Requests**  
   - Send the modified request to the server.  
   - Observe if unauthorized data is returned.

---

### **Step 3: Automate Testing with Burp Extensions**
1. **Use the Autorize Extension**  
   - **Autorize** automatically tests endpoints for authorization issues by replaying requests with tokens from other users.  
   Steps:
   - Install **Autorize** via the BApp Store.
   - Configure low-privilege and high-privilege tokens:
     - Paste the **low-privilege user token** as the unauthorized token.
     - Set the **high-privilege token** as the authorized token.
   - Enable **Autorize** to monitor requests in real-time.

2. **Analyze Results**  
   - Autorize highlights unauthorized access if a low-privileged user can access or manipulate high-privilege resources.

---

### **Step 4: Advanced Techniques**
1. **Parameter Fuzzing**  
   Use **Intruder** to automate testing for predictable object IDs:
   - Send the request to **Intruder**.
   - Define the parameter to fuzz (e.g., the `order_id` in `/orders/{order_id}`).
   - Use a payload generator (e.g., sequential numbers or wordlists) to test multiple IDs.

   Example fuzzing payload:
   ```
   101
   102
   103
   ...
   ```

2. **Session Hijacking**  
   Test if session tokens from one user work for another user:
   - Intercept requests from both accounts.
   - Replace the session token of the low-privileged user with the high-privileged user's token.
   - Send the modified request to see if unauthorized access is granted.

3. **JWT Manipulation**  
   - Decode JWT tokens using **jwt.io** or Burp's **JSON Web Token Editor**.
   - Test altering the `user_id` or `role` claims:
     - Example before:
       ```json
       { "user_id": 123, "role": "user" }
       ```
     - Example after:
       ```json
       { "user_id": 124, "role": "admin" }
       ```

4. **Mass Assignment**  
   - Send payloads with unexpected parameters to test if sensitive fields can be altered:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "user123",
       "isAdmin": true
     }
     ```

### **Example: Burp Suite in Action**
#### Application: Banking App
- Endpoint: `/api/v1/accounts/{account_id}`  
- Low-privilege user has access to `GET /api/v1/accounts/101`.

#### Steps:
1. **Capture and Modify Request**  
   Intercept the request and replace the account ID:
   ```http
   GET /api/v1/accounts/102 HTTP/1.1
   Host: bank.example.com
   Authorization: Bearer <low-privilege-user-token>
   ```

2. **Send the Request**  
   - Check if unauthorized data is returned.
   - Example unauthorized response:
     ```json
     {
       "account_id": 102,
       "balance": 5000,
       "owner": "HighPrivilegeUser"
     }
     ```

3. **Use Autorize**  
   - Configure tokens for low-privilege and high-privilege users.
   - Autorize flags access to `account_id=102` as unauthorized.

---

### **Step 5: Reporting Findings**
When you discover vulnerabilities:
1. Document the exact steps to reproduce the issue.
2. Provide HTTP request/response examples.
3. Highlight the impact (e.g., access to sensitive user data or privilege escalation).
4. Suggest fixes:
   - Enforce object-level authorization checks.
   - Use opaque identifiers (e.g., UUIDs).
   - Log and monitor unauthorized access attempts.

---

### **Additional Tips**
- **Practice Ethical Hacking:** Always have proper authorization from the application owner before testing.
- **Regularly Update Burp Suite:** New features and extensions are regularly added.
- **Integrate with CI/CD:** Use Burp Suite Enterprise for automated scans in your DevOps pipeline.

Using Burp Suite effectively will help uncover and secure vulnerabilities related to object-level authorization.
